# 🚀 Modern Go Backend

> **A production-ready REST API built with Go's standard library, designed for security, simplicity, and developer experience.**

## ✨ Core Values

🔒 **Security First** - CSRF protection, secure session management, and bcrypt password hashing
⚡ **Performance** - Built on Go's efficient `net/http` with minimal external dependencies
🔧 **Developer Experience** - Hot reloading, comprehensive testing, and Docker support
🎯 **Flexibility** - Supports both password and OTP-based authentication flows
🏢 **Multi-Tenant** - Complete tenant isolation with domain-based routing
📦 **Production Ready** - Rate limiting, proper error handling, and database migrations

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Complete tenant isolation with domain-based routing
- **Dual Authentication Modes**: Password-based or OTP-based authentication
- **Session Management**: Secure cookie-based sessions with CSRF protection
- **Hot Reloading**: Instant feedback during development with Air
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit and integration tests with Docker test environment
- **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL with migrations and type-safe queries (sqlc)
- **RESTful API**: Clean endpoints for notes management and authentication

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Runtime**: Go (standard library focused)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **DevOps**: Docker Compose, Air (hot reload)
- **Database Tools**: golang-migrate, sqlc
- **Build Tool**: Make

## 🚀 Quick Start

For a production deployment please check the [deployment guide](./deployment/production/workflow.md). For building the docker production image and pushing it to the docker hub run:

```bash
make build-push
```

### 1. Start the Application for development
```bash
# Start database and backend with hot reloading
docker compose --env-file .env up -d

# Run database migrations
migrate -path internal/db/migrations -database "postgres://${DB_USER}:${DB_PASSWORD}@localhost:5432/${DB_NAME}?sslmode=disable" up
```

### 2. Test the API
```bash
# Register a new user (with tenant origin)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/register \
  -H "Origin: example.com" \
  -d "email=user@example.com" \
  -d "password=mypassword123"

# Login and get session (with tenant origin)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/login \
  -H "Origin: example.com" \
  -d "email=user@example.com" \
  -d "password=mypassword123" \
  -c cookies.txt

# Access protected dashboard
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/dashboard \
  -H "Origin: example.com" \
  -H "X-CSRF-Token: YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -b cookies.txt
```

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Unit tests only
make test-unit

# Integration tests with Docker
make test-integration

# Integration tests with coverage
make test-integration-coverage
```

## 🔧 Development Commands

```bash
# Build the application
make build

# Run without Docker
make run

# View application logs
docker compose logs

# Clean up Docker resources
docker compose down --rmi local -v
```

## 🏢 Multi-Tenant Architecture

The application supports complete tenant isolation:

- **Domain-based Resolution**: Each tenant is identified by their domain via `Origin` header
- **Data Isolation**: All user data is scoped to the tenant context
- **Dynamic Management**: Runtime tenant creation and management via admin API

### Tenant Headers
All requests must include:
```
Origin: your-tenant-domain.com
```

### Tenant Management
Tenants are managed dynamically through admin API endpoints:

```bash
# Create a new tenant
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/admin/tenants \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Example Tenant",
    "domain": "example.com",
    "is_active": true,
    "settings": {
      "otp_enabled": true,
      "session_timeout_minutes": 720
    }
  }'

# List all tenants
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/admin/tenants

# Update a tenant
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/admin/tenants/{id} \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Updated Tenant Name"}'

# Delete a tenant
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/admin/tenants/{id}
```

## 🔐 Authentication Modes

### Password Mode (`OTP_ENABLED=false`)
Traditional email/password authentication with secure session management.

### OTP Mode (`OTP_ENABLED=true`)
Email-based one-time password authentication for enhanced security.

> **Detailed authentication workflow**: See [docs/auth_workflow.md](./docs/auth_workflow.md)
