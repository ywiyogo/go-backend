# GitHub Workflows Documentation

This document describes the comprehensive CI/CD pipeline setup for the Go Backend project, including automated testing, security scanning, building, and deployment workflows.

## Overview

The project uses a modern, multi-stage CI/CD pipeline with the following key features:

- üîí **Security-First**: Automated security scanning, vulnerability detection, and code quality checks
- üöÄ **Performance**: Parallel job execution, intelligent caching, and matrix strategies
- üì¶ **Multi-Platform**: Support for Linux, macOS, and Windows across AMD64 and ARM64 architectures
- üê≥ **Container-Ready**: Docker image building with multi-architecture support
- üîÑ **Automated Dependencies**: Dependabot integration for keeping dependencies up-to-date

## Workflows

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline (`integration-tests.yml`)

**Triggers:** Push to `main`/`develop` branches, Pull Requests
**Purpose:** Comprehensive testing, security scanning, and quality assurance

#### Jobs Overview

### 3. Dependency Management (`dependabot.yml`)

**Purpose:** Automated dependency updates with intelligent grouping

#### Update Schedule

| Ecosystem | Day | Time | Frequency |
|-----------|-----|------|-----------|
| Go modules | Monday | 09:00 | Weekly |
| Docker | Tuesday | 09:00 | Weekly |
| GitHub Actions | Wednesday | 09:00 | Weekly |

#### Grouping Strategy

**Go Dependencies:**
- **go-core**: Standard library and core Go tools
- **database**: PostgreSQL and database-related packages
- **testing**: Testing frameworks and utilities
- **security**: Cryptography and security packages

**GitHub Actions:**
- **actions-official**: Official GitHub Actions
- **setup-actions**: Environment setup actions
- **security-actions**: Security and scanning actions
- **build-actions**: Build and artifact actions

## Usage Examples

### Triggering Workflows

**Automatic Triggers:**
```bash
# Triggers CI/CD pipeline
git push origin main

# Triggers release pipeline  
git tag v1.2.3
git push origin v1.2.3
```

**Manual Triggers:**
```bash
# Manual release (GitHub CLI)
gh workflow run release.yml -f tag=v1.2.3
```

### Local Development

**Run tests locally:**
```bash
# Unit tests
make test-unit

# Integration tests
make test-integration

# All tests
make test
```

**Local security scanning:**
```bash
# Install gosec
go install github.com/securecodewarrior/gosec/v2/cmd/gosec@latest

# Run security scan
gosec ./...
```

### Monitoring Workflows

**GitHub UI:**
- Actions tab for workflow runs
- Security tab for vulnerability reports
- Releases page for published releases

**CLI Monitoring:**
```bash
# List workflow runs
gh run list

# View specific run
gh run view <run-id>

# Download artifacts
gh run download <run-id>
```

## Security Features

### Code Analysis
- **CodeQL**: Semantic code analysis for security vulnerabilities
- **Gosec**: Go-specific security rule scanning
- **Dependency Scanning**: Known vulnerability detection

### Container Security
- **Trivy**: Comprehensive container vulnerability scanning
- **SBOM**: Software Bill of Materials for supply chain security
- **Multi-stage Builds**: Minimal attack surface

### Access Control
- **Permissions**: Least-privilege principle for all jobs
- **Environment Protection**: Manual approval for production deployments
- **Secret Management**: Secure handling of sensitive data

## Performance Optimizations

### Caching Strategy
- **Go Module Cache**: Shared across jobs
- **Docker Layer Cache**: Buildx with GitHub Actions cache
- **Binary Artifacts**: Reused across jobs

### Parallel Execution
- **Matrix Strategies**: Parallel testing across versions/modes
- **Independent Jobs**: Concurrent execution where possible
- **Selective Triggering**: Skip unnecessary jobs

### Resource Management
- **Artifact Retention**: Automated cleanup (7-30 days)
- **Cache Limits**: Optimized cache usage
- **Timeout Controls**: Prevent hanging jobs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Test Failures:**
```bash
# Check logs
gh run view <run-id> --log

# Re-run failed jobs
gh run rerun <run-id> --failed
```

**Security Alerts:**
- Check Security tab in GitHub
- Review SARIF uploads in Actions
- Update dependencies via Dependabot PRs

**Release Issues:**
- Verify tag format (`v*`)
- Check pre-release security scans
- Validate binary compilation across platforms

### Debug Mode

**Enable debug logging:**
```yaml
- name: Debug Step
  run: echo "Debug information"
  env:
    ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG: true
```

**Local debugging:**
```bash
# Act (local Actions runner)
act -j unit-tests

# Docker debugging
docker run -it --rm gobackend:test /bin/sh
```
